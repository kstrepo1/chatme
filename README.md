# Chatme

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.1.1.
The project is part one of a 3813ICT Assignment. This project will be created using a MEAN Stack. 

## Github Organisation
Github has been used as a tool to track creation and modification of code. Commits have been used for major changes and implementations of the software. 

## Data Structures 
Two core objects run this first phase of the assignement. These are the "authedusers" object (located in the authcheck service) which stored the user list and the "grouplist" which has a seperate list storing group names, channel lists, admins and the ID for the group creator. Once MONGO DB is implemented this can be swapped over in a smooth manner. 

## Angular Setup 
Angular has been used as the front end software library. Angular brings web-apps together using components, services and routes. 
You will see the layout of the app, its components and services under `./src/app` 






## Further Angular Information 

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
